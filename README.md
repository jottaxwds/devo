## Description:
The exercises were developed by using javascript. A main.js is provided and could be used to run the exercises with hardcoded input values since the exercises only ask for the implementation of the methods that allow to get the expected outcome from each one.

Methods are unit tested considering cornercases.
Additional validation functions were created for k-complementary exercise.

## Requirements:
Is required to have NodeJS installed.

To install node, you can get rid of NVM (Node Version Management) that can be easily installed following this documentation in the official github repo: 
- ![NVM (Node Version Manager) Official Repo](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) 

## Instructions:
- Open terminal and go to project directory.
- Run this command to execute the exercises with hardcoded input data values: `node main.js`
- Run unit tests: 
  - 1st, *JEST* & needed dependencies should be installed -> `yarn install`
  - 2nd, use this command to run the tests -> `yarn install`

## Correctness:
- does it work? Yes
-  Is it tested? Yes
-  Is it well designed? N/A
-  Is the code easy to comprehend? Yes
-  Performs well? 
-  Would this code be easy to extend or maintain? The solution is made using functional programming. That means, each method has it owns responsibility. The scalability remains on the "pieces" someone needs to add to this existing code and the combination between them.
